Object Oriented Shell

Hello everybody out there using bash -

This repository is designed to gather ideas about a new type of shell for the operating system.

Please review https://github.com/tomerfiliba/plumbum and https://www.pixelbeat.org/docs/coreutils-gotchas.html
along with https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/papers/hotos21-s06-greenberg.pdf to see where this is going.

I am currently collecting feature requests.

- Make OOP API compatible with all OOP languages.
- Simple
- Configure with Curses/Blessed UI
- Save History Instantly so that nothing is lost upon a crash.
